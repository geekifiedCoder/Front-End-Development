If HTML is the **core technology**, you can define **CSS** and **JavaScript** as complementary technologies that enhance and extend the capabilities of HTML, each serving a distinct purpose in the web development process:

### **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): The Stylist**
- **Definition**: CSS is a technology used to style and visually present the content defined by HTML.
- **Purpose**: It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall aesthetic of a webpage, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Role**: While HTML provides the structure, CSS separates content from design, allowing developers to apply consistent styling across multiple pages and create responsive designs for various devices.

### **JavaScript (JS): The Interactivity Layer**
- **Definition**: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to a website.
- **Purpose**: It enables features such as animations, form validation, dynamic content updates, interactive maps, and more.
- **Role**: JavaScript transforms static HTML and CSS into interactive web applications, providing a richer and more engaging user experience.

### Analogy
- **HTML**: The foundation or skeleton of a building.
- **CSS**: The paint, decorations, and furnishings that make the building look attractive and functional.
- **JavaScript**: The systems and gadgets (e.g., elevators, lights, smart devices) that make the building interactive and user-friendly.

### Summary
- HTML is the **core** structure.
- CSS defines the **style** and visual presentation.
- JavaScript provides **behavior** and interactivity.

Together, they form the triad of modern web development technologies.
